PIN less top-up for mySabay accounts
====================================

This guide describes how to implement PIN less top-up for mySabay accounts. 

This guide is using the direct payment workflow where customers are entering their customer details with the payment provider and the payment provider will execute a payment to the merchant using SSN. Payment Providers do not need to provision any API for this service.

# About mySabay

mySabay is a platform used by players to manage game accounts and top-up game coins for games offered by Sabay Digital and its partners. Players can either top-up their mySabay account or transfer money into individual games and services directly. In this workflow the player will top-up his mySabay account.

# Pre-requisite 

* Merchant agreement with Sabay Digital 
* Settlement agreement with SSN
* Understanding of the Stellar Blockchain (basic principals) https://stellar.org
* understanding of making transactions on SSN (using SDK's provided by Stellar or 3rd parties)

## More information

* https://github.com/sabay-digital/org.ssn.doc.public public library for all documents related to SSN published by Sabay
* https://api-reference.ssn.digital/ API reference for all API's used by SSN
* https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/get-started/index.html documentation from the SDF
* https://www.stellar.org/developers/horizon/reference/ REST API documentation for Horizon, the API endpoint used by SSN to access the blockchain

## Tools to use for SSN 

* https://t.me/ssn_digital join the SSN telegram group, the group bot can seed your test account
* https://lab.ssn.digital blockchain lab from SDF
* https://explorer.ssn.digital blockchain explorer from Sabay
* https://api.testing.ssn.digital Testing network Blockchain API endpoint
* Testing Network Passphrase: ssn_testing_network

NOTE: The horizon endpoint https://horizon.testing.ssn.digital can still be use in the testing network. Access in the production network will only be via the API endpoint https://api.ssn.digital. If you find a function in your SDK which does not work with API but works with Horizon endpoint, please inform us.

## Libraries used

* stellar sdk, see section libraries on https://www.stellar.org/developers/horizon/reference/

The library has implementations in all major programming languages. 

## Setup on the test network

1) create a key pair using the blockchain lab https://lab.ssn.digital/
2) join SSN telegram group and open an account using your public key and the group chat bot (/help)
3) setup your account as payment provider account (permissions and KYC)
4) request our team to apply for a trustline to your account
5) Accept trust for Sabay Digital's "mySabay user account top-up" account for the asset 

The mySabay top-up account is ```GBNV4PMFUTPYRKVQZV7V47W46KGZLKK5GWVAEXYPS7QJVQWY4B6X43JS``` on the testing network and production network.

Configure your account:
* Account setting [TR001](../tr/tr001.md)
* KYC settings [TR006](../tr/tr006.md)

## Setup your SSN toml configuration

In order for the network to discover what assets you offer and where to connect to your API, digital asset issuers are required to publish a SSN toml file [TR007](../tr/tr007.md). For direct payments there is no need to call a API from the merchant site, however the merchant may access your SSN configuration to determine the currency for the payment.

* set your accounts home_domain
* upload your toml file and define the assets you want to offer (USD, KHR) 

The key pair used on the test network can also be used on the production network. The toml file in this case can be served from the final production setup.

# Workflow for direct top-up

Flow for a direct PIN less top-up to a mySabay account

1) request mySabay userID from your customer and create the payment address
2) query the payment address federated domain for the ssn.toml configuration and resolve the address
3) ask the customer for the top-up amount and currency
4) build and submit the transaction on SSN

## Step 1 (Finding information about the payment destination)

Resolving payment destinations on SSN is based on using payment addresses. A payment address is a formated string ```[user or bill identifier]*[domain].[tld]```, similar to an email address but using the [*] as divider between the user part and the domain part. Payment address will be resolved by the merchant and return needed information about the payment destination (and other payment details).

For top-up`s to mySabay user accounts the domain part is ```mysabay.com``` (or ```testing.mysabay.com``` in testing network) and the user part is the mySabay User ID, a 8 digit number e.g. ```37837941```. 

Within your application you need to ask the user to input his mySabay User ID and then construct a payment address which you can use to find the destination account and verify the user account exists. An example payment address on the test network would be ```37837941*testing.mysabay.com```. 

**Note**

The payment address should be constructed in the same way for each merchant on SSN: 

* left side of the [*] is the unique identifier which you need to query from the user as data input and 
* the right side is the home domain of the merchant

At Sabay the following domains can be used to top-up different accounts, using the same workflow:

| Domain | left side input | purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| mysabay.com | mySabay User ID | top-up to user accounts |
| reseller.mysabay.com | reseller ID | top-up to reseller accounts |
| enovel.sabay.com | user phone number | top-up direct to E-novel mobile app |
| soyo.sabay.com | Users phone number | top-up Soyo subscription |

Not all services are available to all payment providers, please inquire with our support team to enable direct top-up.

## Step 2 (resolving the payment information)

To resolve a payment address, the payment provider must use the domain part of the payment address to find the configuration file for the domain. The configuration file must be hosted (same as the payment provider ssn.toml) at the well-know location:

```
https://DOMAIN/.well-known/ssn.toml
https://testing.mysabay.com/.well-known/ssn.toml
```

The merchant must define a valid payment address resolver using the following attribute: 

```
FEDERATION_SERVER="https://pa.ssn.digital/v2/resolve"
```

The payment address resolver is implement using the following API [SSN Payment Address Resolver](https://api-reference.ssn.digital/?urls.primaryName=SSN%20Payment%20Address%20Resolver%20APIv2) and returns a simple json object with the payment routing information to be used to build the transaction. 


```bash
curl -X POST "https://pa.ssn.digital/v2/resolve/37837941*testing.mysabay.com" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\
        \"hash\"         : \"431326289191edb3dc94f90e1e0e5d8899bf7ecb196c00cc3b9506dc7ed05eff\"\
        \"signature\"    : \"2fa7689f88ebb464536418c32dfd4f36d3936ffcdad3d4b8c55531963bd1645dabdb431b7db6f56dd940e591e8f2a65c7776f3254e892c96a183179fb2fb8c0d\"\
        \"signer\"       : \"GAYJ2HEGE4XGITUE2GQ7VA73ZT3V3Z4C47YLCEINTHTKTIEXACDNXJM3\"\
        \"ssn_account\"  : \"GARXYJB3ZUJ7DNQTDWYE5PWO356ZOXD26NQJZPPM7CDAQP5YPWAWHD36\"\
      }"
```

response

```json
{
  "network_address": "GBNV4PMFUTPYRKVQZV7V47W46KGZLKK5GWVAEXYPS7QJVQWY4B6X43JS",
  "payment_type": "merchant",
  "service_name": "mySabay User Top-up",
  "status": 200,
  "details": {
    "payment_info": "[User Display Name]",
    "memo": "37837941@1",
    "payment": [
      {
        "asset_code": "USD"
      },
      {
        "asset_code": "KHR"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The return for mySabay top-up`s will not contain the payment amount but it will contain a list of all currencies mySabay will accept from the payment provider. The resolver will have performed a lookup for the existing trustlines with the ```ssn_account```.

***The resolver may not return any details, if the request is not signed and authenticated for a payment provider the merchant trusts.***

## Step 3 (query user for amount)

The resolver for mySabay may return multiple currencies (assets) in which the payment can be made, depending on the assets the payment provider issues and Sabay accepts. The payment provider should verify if the account to which the payment will be made, has the necessary trustlines for the asset. *This should also have been verified by the payment address resolver, however payment providers are advised to verify the information.*

**Please remember: each asset issued (representing a currency) on SSN needs a separate trustline and approval from the payment provider and merchant.**

You can check the status for your assets using the [SSN API](https://api-reference.ssn.digital/) on SSN and the /verify/trust/ endpoint.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.testing.ssn.digital/v1/verify/trust" \
    -H "accept: application/json" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"  \
    -d "{\
        \"account\"      : \"GBNV4PMFUTPYRKVQZV7V47W46KGZLKK5GWVAEXYPS7QJVQWY4B6X43JS\", \
        \"asset_code\"   : \"USD\", \
        \"asset_issuer\" : \"GARXYJB3ZUJ7DNQTDWYE5PWO356ZOXD26NQJZPPM7CDAQP5YPWAWHD36\"}"
```
response

```json
{
    "status":200,
    "title":"asset will be accepted by account"
}
```

Once you know which assets are accepted and you know which assets the user has, you can offer a currency selection and ask for the amount the user wants to top-up. Please note for payments to other merchants the amount and currency could already be included in the resolver return.

In case the user does not have an account in the asset which was requested, e.g. the payment request is in KHR but the user only has an USD account, the payment provider should offer a a currency conversion. Settlement between merchant and payment provider will always be in the asset that has been issued in the payment process.

## Step 4

**Before submitting the transaction to the network, you need to ensure you deduct the amount from the balance of the user and transfer it to the escrow account for assets issued on SSN.**

The transaction should be build with the transaction builder API as documented in the [SSN API](https://api-reference.ssn.digital/). The resolver result maps to the API call as follows

| PA return | API call | value
| --- | --- | ---
|  | from | sender account (in most cases same as asset issuer)
| network_address | to | address of the merchant on SSN
|  | amount | Amount to pay (user input)
| memo | memo | Merchant defined memo (not to be altered)
|  | asset_code | USD or KHR (user input)
|  | asset_issuer | Asset issuing account of the provider


```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.testing.ssn.digital/v1/create/transaction" \
    -H "accept: application/json" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\
        \"from\"         : \"GARXYJB3ZUJ7DNQTDWYE5PWO356ZOXD26NQJZPPM7CDAQP5YPWAWHD36\", \
        \"to\"           : \"GBNV4PMFUTPYRKVQZV7V47W46KGZLKK5GWVAEXYPS7QJVQWY4B6X43JS\", \
        \"amount\"       : \"5\", \
        \"memo\"         : \"37837941@1\", \
        \"asset_code\"   : \"USD\", \
        \"asset_issuer\" : \"GARXYJB3ZUJ7DNQTDWYE5PWO356ZOXD26NQJZPPM7CDAQP5YPWAWHD36\"}"
```
response

```json
{
    "status":200,
    "envelope_xdr":"AAAAACB+baVTd4GY.....Oa0XKT0izzArSDaCPtbAzc9FAw=="
}
```

The API will return a transaction envelop in the XDR format. The transaction is time bound and must be submitted within the next 300 seconds. The transaction can then be loaded into the SDK, signed by a authorized key for the ```from``` account and submitted to the network.

Python code example:

```python
from stellar_sdk import Server, TransactionBuilder, Signer, Network, Keypair
import sys

XDR = sys.argv[1]
SIGN_KP = Keypair.from_seed( 'SECRET_KEY_FOR_PROVIDER' )

server = Server(horizon_url="https://api.testing.ssn.digital")
transaction = TransactionBuilder.from_xdr(xdr=XDR, network_id= 'ssn_testing_network' )
transaction.sign(SIGN_KP)
response = server.submit_transaction(transaction)
```

Java code example (The imported library can be found [here](https://github.com/stellar/java-stellar-sdk/releases)):

```java
import org.stellar.sdk.*;

public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Load the signing keypair for the asset issuing account
        KeyPair signer = KeyPair.fromSecretSeed("SAPIAQNGL6LMP4PQK5KKZ3WEAGINLVSCKUJF75UCRCFEGUHZSNHPSEYD");
        System.out.println(signer.getAccountId());

        // This is the transaction envelope from the /create/transaction API endpoint
        String xdr = "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";

        // Set the network name - ssn_testing_network or ssn_production_network
        Network testnet = new Network("ssn_testing_network");
        try {
            // Load the transaction
            Transaction payment = Transaction.fromEnvelopeXdr(xdr, testnet);

            // Sign
            payment.sign(signer);

            // Show the signed result that can be submitted to the /transactions API endpoint
            System.out.println(payment.toEnvelopeXdrBase64());
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Something went wrong");
        }
    }
}
```

The API will return a json object with the transaction details (on success). The transaction may take up to 5 seconds to be included in the next ledger. Should the connection be closed without receiving a response, you can query your account for the last transaction.

```json
{
  "_links": {
    "transaction": {
      "href": "https://horizon.ssn.digital/transactions/6d877ba0bb5d899e415c59bb9f90b83898b3ab2287cf93299cbb39fc09f28c95"
    }
  },
  "hash": "6d877ba0bb5d899e415c59bb9f90b83898b3ab2287cf93299cbb39fc09f28c95",
  "ledger": 1973255,
  "envelope_xdr": "AAAAAJVkSQrzv.....AAAAAAAAAAAAAFAAAAAAAAAAA=",
  "result_meta_xdr": "AAAAAQAAAAIAAAADAB4cBwAAA.....AMgAAAAAAAAAA"
}
```

The Network API will fail instantly if the transaction is not in order, e.g. missing signatures, no trustlines or out of submission time window.

```json
{
  "type": "https://stellar.org/horizon-errors/transaction_malformed",
  "title": "Transaction Malformed",
  "status": 400,
  "detail": "Horizon could not decode the transaction envelope in this request. A transaction should be an XDR TransactionEnvelope struct encoded using base64.  The envelope read from this request is echoed in the `extras.envelope_xdr` field of this response for your convenience.",
  "extras": {
    "envelope_xdr": "AAAAAJVkSQrzvgJpDRNjm1HY1KOL.....ya6upe3E+QPz1mXiQwRD4uxOIZqcSlc"
  }
}
```

An error always means the transaction as submitted is invalid and needs to be rebuild before submitting it again. Errors are documented in the [REST API documentation](https://www.stellar.org/developers/horizon/reference/) as published by the SDF .

The ```transaction hash``` should be stored with the payment providers records, and shown as prove of the success to the user on demand. The transaction hash is visible and stored with the mySabay receiver and can be used by customer service to validate the transaction. SSN also provides a public endpoint to validate the transaction using the transaction hash.
